    'gastroenteritis treatment': 'Gastroenteritis treatment focuses on preventing dehydration, relieving symptoms, and promoting recovery. This may involve drinking plenty of fluids such as water, electrolyte solutions (such as Pedialyte or Gatorade), clear broths, or diluted fruit juices to replace lost fluids and electrolytes, and avoiding foods and beverages that can worsen diarrhea or vomiting (such as caffeine, alcohol, dairy products, fatty or spicy foods). In some cases, over-the-counter medications such as loperamide (Imodium) or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) may be used to reduce the frequency of bowel movements and relieve symptoms of diarrhea or abdominal cramping. Antibiotics are not usually recommended for viral gastroenteritis unless complications such as severe dehydration or bacterial superinfection occur.',
    'urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment': 'Urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment typically involves antibiotics (such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, or fosfomycin) to kill the bacteria causing the infection and relieve symptoms such as pain, burning with urination, and frequent urination. It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed by your healthcare provider, even if symptoms improve before the medication is finished, to prevent recurrence or antibiotic resistance. Drinking plenty of fluids, urinating frequently, and practicing good hygiene (such as wiping from front to back after using the bathroom) can also help prevent UTIs and promote recovery.',

Medications such as antacids, H2 receptor antagonists (such as ranitidine or famotidine), proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole or esomeprazole), or prokinetics (such as metoclopramide) may also be prescribed to reduce stomach acid production, relieve symptoms, and promote healing of the esophagus. In severe cases or complications such as esophagitis, Barrett\'s esophagus, or esophageal strictures, surgery (such as fundoplication) may be recommended to reinforce the lower esophageal sphincter and prevent reflux.',
    'migraine treatment': 'Migraine treatment may involve medications such as analgesics (such as acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen), triptans (such as sumatriptan or rizatriptan) to relieve migraine pain and associated symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to light and sound, or preventive medications (such as beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, or CGRP inhibitors) to reduce the frequency and severity of migraines. Lifestyle modifications such as getting regular sleep, managing stress, staying hydrated, avoiding trigger foods and beverages, and practicing relaxation techniques or biofeedback may also help prevent migraines and improve quality of life. In some cases, intravenous medications or nerve blocks may be used to treat severe migraines or migraines that do not respond to oral medications.',
    'insomnia treatment': 'Insomnia treatment may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) techniques such as stimulus control, sleep restriction, relaxation training, cognitive therapy, or sleep hygiene education to improve sleep habits, regulate sleep-wake cycles, and reduce anxiety about sleep. Medications such as sedative-hypnotics (such as zolpidem, eszopiclone, or temazepam), melatonin receptor agonists (such as ramelteon), or low-dose antidepressants (such as trazodone or amitriptyline) may also be prescribed to help initiate or maintain sleep, but are generally recommended for short-term use due to potential side effects and risk of dependency. Lifestyle modifications such as establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, limiting caffeine and alcohol intake, and avoiding stimulating activities before bedtime can also help improve sleep quality and duration.',
    'obesity management': 'Obesity management involves adopting a comprehensive approach to weight loss and maintenance that includes dietary modifications, increased physical activity, behavior therapy, and, in some cases, medications or bariatric surgery. This may involve working with a multidisciplinary healthcare team that includes physicians, dietitians, exercise physiologists, psychologists, and other specialists to develop a personalized treatment plan based on individual needs, preferences, and goals. Strategies for weight loss may include following a reduced-calorie diet that is high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, engaging in regular physical activity (such as aerobic exercise, strength training, or flexibility exercises) for at least 150 minutes per week, keeping track of food intake and physical activity, identifying and addressing triggers for overeating, practicing stress management techniques, and seeking social support from friends, family members, or support groups. In some cases, medications such as orlistat, phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion, or liraglutide may be prescribed to help suppress appetite, reduce food cravings, or block fat absorption, but are generally recommended for individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher or a BMI of 27 or higher with obesity-related health problems. Bariatric surgery such as gastric bypass, gastric sleeve, or adjustable gastric banding may be considered for individuals with severe obesity (BMI of 40 or higher) or moderate obesity (BMI of 35 or higher) with significant obesity-related health problems who have not responded to other weight loss interventions, but is typically reserved for those who have made unsuccessful attempts to lose weight through diet and exercise alone.',
